## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Backend (ASP.NET Core + GraphQL)
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 9.0 with HotChocolate GraphQL
- **Database**: SQLite with Entity Framework Core
- **API**: GraphQL with queries and mutations for task management

### Frontend (Next.js + Adobe React Spectrum + Relay)
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Turbopack
- **UI Library**: Adobe React Spectrum for consistent, accessible components
- **GraphQL Client**: Relay for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Database**: Persistent SQLite storage with Docker volumes

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ (for local development)
- .NET 9.0 SDK (for local development)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd todo-app

# Start all services with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000

## üìä GraphQL Schema

### Queries
- `getAllTasks`: Retrieve all tasks with filtering, sorting, and projection support
- `getTaskById(id: Int!)`: Get a specific task by ID

### Mutations
- `createTask(input: CreateTaskInput!)`: Create a new task
- `updateTaskStatus(input: UpdateTaskStatusInput!)`: Update task status (Pending/Completed)
- `deleteTask(id: Int!)`: Delete a task

### Types
```graphql
type TaskItem {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  description: String
  status: TaskStatus!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

enum TaskStatus {
  PENDING
  COMPLETED
}
```

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Development Approach

This project showcases a modern AI-assisted development workflow using multiple specialized tools:

### 1. Planning & Architecture (Google Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- **Purpose**: High-level project planning and architecture design
- **Effectiveness**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Usage**: 
  - Initial project requirements analysis
  - Technology stack recommendations
  - Architecture pattern suggestions (GraphQL vs REST, frontend framework selection)
  - Database design considerations

**Reflection**: Gemini 2.5 Pro excelled at understanding complex project requirements and providing comprehensive architectural guidance. Its ability to consider trade-offs between different approaches (e.g., Relay vs Apollo Client, SQLite vs PostgreSQL) was particularly valuable for making informed decisions early in the project.

### 2. Code Implementation (Cursor with Roo Coder)
- **Purpose**: Rapid code generation and implementation
- **Effectiveness**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Usage**:
  - Entity model creation with proper validation attributes
  - GraphQL resolver implementation with HotChocolate
  - React component scaffolding with Adobe React Spectrum
  - Docker configuration optimization

**Reflection**: Cursor with Roo Coder proved exceptional for translating architectural decisions into working code. The AI's understanding of modern development patterns (dependency injection, async/await, GraphQL best practices) significantly accelerated development while maintaining code quality.

### 3. Code Quality & Review (CodeRabbit)
- **Purpose**: Automated code review and quality assurance
- **Effectiveness**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Usage**:
  - Security vulnerability scanning
  - Performance optimization suggestions
  - Code style and consistency enforcement
  - Best practice recommendations

**Reflection**: CodeRabbit's automated reviews caught several potential issues including:
- Missing input validation in GraphQL mutations
- Inefficient database queries without proper indexing
- Security considerations for CORS configuration
- Performance improvements for Docker multi-stage builds

### 4. Infrastructure & Deployment (Claude Code)
- **Purpose**: Server setup and deployment automation
- **Effectiveness**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Usage**:
  - EC2 instance configuration and hardening
  - Nginx reverse proxy setup with SSL termination
  - Docker deployment pipeline creation
  - Environment-specific configuration management

**Reflection**: Claude Code's systematic approach to infrastructure setup was particularly valuable. Its ability to handle complex deployment scenarios while maintaining security best practices (SSL certificates, firewall configuration, container security) made production deployment seamless.

## üîÑ Development Workflow & Problem-Solving Approach

### 1. Requirements Analysis & Planning
- Used Gemini 2.5 Pro to break down the project into manageable components
- Identified key technical decisions early (GraphQL vs REST, UI framework selection)
- Created a comprehensive technology matrix considering scalability, maintainability, and developer experience

### 2. Iterative Implementation
- **Backend-First Approach**: Started with data models and GraphQL schema
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Built core functionality before advanced features
- **Test-Driven Validation**: Used GraphQL Playground for immediate API testing

### 3. Quality Assurance Integration
- Automated code reviews with each commit using CodeRabbit
- Continuous feedback loop for security and performance optimization
- Regular architecture reviews to ensure adherence to initial design principles

### 4. Deployment & Operations
- Infrastructure as Code approach using Docker Compose
- Automated deployment pipeline with health checks
- Production-ready configuration with proper logging and monitoring hooks

## üéØ Key Technical Decisions & Rationale

### GraphQL over REST
- **Decision**: Used GraphQL with HotChocolate
- **Rationale**: Better for complex data relationships, built-in introspection, and type safety
- **AI Insight**: Gemini 2.5 Pro highlighted the benefits for this specific use case

### Adobe React Spectrum over Custom Components
- **Decision**: Chose Adobe React Spectrum for UI components
- **Rationale**: Enterprise-grade accessibility, consistent design system, comprehensive component library
- **AI Insight**: Cursor identified integration patterns that simplified implementation

### Relay over Apollo Client
- **Decision**: Selected Relay as the GraphQL client
- **Rationale**: Optimized for performance, built-in caching strategies, better for complex applications
- **AI Insight**: CodeRabbit suggested performance optimizations specific to Relay's architecture

### SQLite over PostgreSQL (Initial)
- **Decision**: Started with SQLite for development simplicity
- **Rationale**: Zero-configuration, portable, sufficient for initial requirements
- **AI Insight**: Claude Code provided migration path to PostgreSQL for production scaling

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Backend Optimizations
- Entity Framework query optimization with projection support
- GraphQL field-level permissions and filtering

## ü§î Reflections on AI-Assisted Development

### What Worked Exceptionally Well
1. **Rapid Prototyping**: AI tools reduced initial setup time by ~80%
2. **Best Practice Enforcement**: Automated suggestions prevented common mistakes
3. **Cross-Technology Integration**: AI handled complex integration patterns seamlessly
4. **Documentation Generation**: Comprehensive documentation with minimal manual effort

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Context Switching**: Moving between AI tools required mental overhead
2. **Code Consistency**: Different AI tools occasionally suggested conflicting patterns
3. **Learning Curve**: Understanding when to use which AI tool effectively

### Key Learnings

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Best results come from iterative collaboration between human insight and AI capabilities

## üèÜ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of combining multiple AI tools in a complementary workflow. The synergy between strategic planning (Gemini), rapid implementation (Cursor/Roo), quality assurance (CodeRabbit), and deployment automation (Claude Code) created a development experience that was both efficient and high-quality.

The key to success was understanding each tool's strengths and using them in the appropriate phase of development, while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions around architecture, security, and user experience.
